      <p>
        Multi-step forms are a great way to break long forms into multiple pieces. By allowing users to submit information in smaller chunks, you can create a positive user experience and increase conversions. Each chunk appears less intimidating and users can be encouraged to complete the form with a progress indicator.
      </p>
      <p>
        One key advantage of multi-step forms is the ability to capture sensitive information by starting with a low-friction question that engages users. In this Newsletter Subscription example, the first question is "What are your interests?" Not only is it a low friction question, it also puts the user in the frame of mind where theyâ€™re thinking about the benefit of your product/service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other advantages include the ability to use custom formatted inputs that's optimized for mobile, and also the ability to use conditional logic to personalize or pre-filter the questions at later steps.
